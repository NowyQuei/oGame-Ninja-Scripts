Since I quit Ogame, I want to share all of my scripts for free.  
First of all: Shout out to all my customers, I thank you for all the support. I hope that I don't offend any of you by sharing my scripts.  
I decided to share my scripts, because Ogame and Ninjabot will change continously and I don't have the time anymore to keep my scripts updated.  
My hope is that the community can build upon some of these scripts and share it with each other, so that everyone is happy. If not just make the best of it while they still work :)  
I would appriciate a little donation for anyone who got something out of my scripts. Paypal: humainguide55[at]hotmail.com .  Totally up to you guys ;)
